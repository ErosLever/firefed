# Firefed

Firefed is a command-line tool to inspect Firefox profiles. It can extract saved passwords, examine preferences, addons, history, cache entries, and more. You may use it for forensic analysis, to audit your config for insecure settings or just to quickly retrieve some data from your profile without having to start up the browser.
